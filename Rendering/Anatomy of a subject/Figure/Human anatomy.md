  - An introduction to human anatomy can be ["How I Draw ANATOMY"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB_SW4ry4DM&list=PLB5nUgozRxF-ak_GHT1_z9qrZ0Cp5ZTJi)
  which is oriented to animation. Warning: She doesn't apply all the steps in every video which can be confusing.
  You need to remember that previous steps should be applied before doing the next step

## Gesture

### Basics

#### Resources:
 - [How I Draw ANATOMY #1: Basic Gesture Drawing](https://youtu.be/jB_SW4ry4DM)

### Line of actions

Describe the flow of the body
Main line of action: Longest line of the body

Avoid poses without line of actions for study

S curve vs C curve [Rendering anatomy for more details](../principles.md)
 - C curve add more balance in the poses (add more information about the weight source)
 - S curve add more flow

### Silhouette

Basics shapes of the character / object you want to draw
Silhouette make the poses more dynamic

## Structure

### Basics shapes of the body

Basics shapes of the body are used to summarize the subject more accurately than when putting down the gesture.
For the moment we don't care about much details in the anatomy forms but more the global shape of the part and how the shape
is connected to the rest of the body.

#### Head

Head as been summarize into the Loomis heads: (You can go in detail here but we will go back later on this)

#### Arms
Arm in the first place can be summarized as cylinders. We can add more detail with the design chain principle. ![Chain desing](https://www.proko.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/chain-design-of-the-arm.jpg)

These resource are too much in the detail for the moment. Keep in mind that you will see it in more detail later

#### Hands

Hands can be summarized as a pave for the paum and a curved pave for the fingers as a muffle.
Then you can add the thumb as a flatted cone with a cylinder on top

Pelvis can be summarized as a flatted cone.

#### Legs

Legs can be summarized in a first place as 2 cylinders for each part. And you can refine it by understanding the leg movement.
You have the front of the upper leg that is curved and the back that is straight. Whereas it's the opposite for the lower leg,
where the front is straight and the back is curved.
You can also apply a angle between the upper and the lower leg. The upper leg is slightly angling inward and the lower leg is angling outward.

#### Foot

Foot can be summarized as a triangle which follow the perspective and you can detail a bit more further by dividing into the 3 part described in the Proko video.

#### Connect all the body part

### Proportions

Proportions is used to measure that our character / object has coherent parts size.
Remember that proportions can be twisted, but twisting a part leads to stylization. 
When doing a study you should measure the proportions of the subject.

### Refine a body part

*This section is still a bit messy as I am not an expert in human anatomy.*

To draw a body part in detail you need to first draw the basic shape of the part then the secondary shapes that sculpts the body part, and add detail later.
As you would do for studying a subject. I'll drop here some resources that helped me understands each part of the body.

You should also study the construction of a body part to understand volumes and rigidness of the part.
 - Basic shape
 - Skeleton
 - Muscles
 - Skin on top
