## Starting is hard

To improve your drawing some fundamentals are needed. I am trying to compile and structure the fundamentals you can find on the internet.
These are not exauhstive but if you are lost as I was to find a strating point. I hope this post will help you.

You should start with the Basic elements of a picture before anythin else. But then you should move around in the folders to find what you
are most interested in. Deeper you go in the folder's tree more complex the resource will get. If you find something too hard don't hesitate
to go back on the previous lesson (folder up) and exercise your self.

Happy navigation.
