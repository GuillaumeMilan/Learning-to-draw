# Shape

## Flat shape

Let's first train our self by training on drawing simple shape.
The objective of this first step in our training is to be more common with our tools.
You will never end going back to this step of learning. You should also use this exercises as warming-up before a drawing session.

 - In the first exercise we don't care about the position precision.
   - Draw line in every angle
   - Draw C curve in every angle.
   - Draw S curve in every angle.
   - Draw a circle and ellipses. (Here the important part is to finish the circle cleanly and avoid the little tail that appear if you don't finish where you started)
 - Here we care about the placements of our shapes.
   - Draw 2 points on your paper and try to join them with a line. Repeat it in different angle.
   - Draw 3 points on your paper and try to join them with a C curve. Repeat it in different angle.
   - Draw 4 points on your paper and try to join them with a S curve. Repeat it in different angle.
   - Draw 2 point on your paper. One is the center of your circle the other is the radius. Try to draw the circle. Repeat it in different angle for the points.

You can add variant. Where you need to be precise and others where you need to be fast.
The objective is to improve your line.

## Going 3D

Now our objective is to go 3D to add depth in our drawing. Same as before we want to exercise our self on basic 3D shapes.

 - Cube
 - Sphere
 - Cylinder and disks
 - Cones and pyramids
 - ...
 
The exercise is to take a shape and draw it in all angle.

Start in the middle of your paper and draw the shape on one face (for example a square for the cube)
- Then on left and right redraw the cube slightly rotated on the top/bottom axis (as if the cube was rolling) and repeat the process until you reach a complete rotation.
- Then on top and bottom redraw the cube slightly rotated on the left/right axis (as if the cube was rolling) and repeat the process until you reach a complete rotation.
- Now you can complete all the page by adding all the rotation variant for every line.


## Use it in your drawing

This video is an example on how you can use the shapes you learned to draw previously to construct your drawing.
